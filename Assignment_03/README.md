# Text Growing and Shrinking
  The Text Growing and Shrinking program is a JavaScript code snippet that displays the text "TEXT-GROWING" with increasing font size.   Once the font size reaches 50pt, the text changes to "TEXT-SHRINKING" in blue color, and then the font size gradually decreases to 5pt.

# Getting Started
  To view the Text Growing and Shrinking program, open the TextSize.html file in a web browser.

# Usage
  Open the TextSize.html file in a web browser.
  The text "TEXT-GROWING" will be displayed on the page.
  The text will continuously increase in font size every 100 milliseconds until it reaches 50pt.
  Once the font size reaches 50pt, the text will change to "TEXT-SHRINKING" and the color will change to blue.
  The font size will gradually decrease from 50pt to 5pt.
  The process will continue in a loop, growing and shrinking the text indefinitely.
