# Vowels & Reverse
  The Vowels & Reverse program is a JavaScript code snippet that finds the left-most vowel in a string and reverses a given number. The   program provides an interactive user interface where you can enter a string or number, and it will display the position of the left-    most vowel if the input is a string or the reversed number if the input is a number.

# Getting Started
  To use the Vowels & Reverse program, follow these steps:

    Open the revers.html file in a web browser.
    You will see an input field where you can enter a string or number.
    After entering the input, click on the "Process Input" button.
    The program will display the output below the button, indicating either the position of the left-most vowel in the string or the        reversed number.

# Usage
  Enter a string or number in the input field.
  Click the "Process Input" button to process the input.
  The program will display the output based on the input:
  If the input is a string:
  The program will find the left-most vowel in the string and display its position.
  If no vowel is found, it will display "No vowel found".
  If the input is a number:
  The program will reverse the number and display the reversed value.

# Example
  If you enter the string "chetan" in the input field and click the "Process Input" button, the output will be "Position: 2" since the    left-most vowel 'e' is at position 3.

  If you enter the number 12345 in the input field and click the "Process Input" button, the output will be "Reversed: 54321" since the   number is reversed.
